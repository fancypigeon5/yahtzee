## How to play

Yahtzee is a classic dice game where you get three throws each turn to roll five dice to get a desired outcome.
Each turn the player decides where on the scoresheet he wants to put the throw.
the game ends after 13 rounds when all of the possible places on the scoresheet have been filled.

choosing dice to keep and/or where to fill in the throw is done by writing the corresponding letters when asked.
